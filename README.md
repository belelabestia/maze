# Challenge: Maze generator / solver

## Description

Create a program that generates and solves mazes.  
The program should be able to:

1. **Generate a random maze** of specified dimensions.
2. **Display the maze** in a readable format (e.g., using ASCII characters).
3. **Find and display the path** from the start position to the end position.

## Requirements

- Use a maze generation algorithm, such as Prim's algorithm or Kruskal's algorithm.
- Use a maze-solving algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- Provide a simple user interface to specify the maze dimensions.
